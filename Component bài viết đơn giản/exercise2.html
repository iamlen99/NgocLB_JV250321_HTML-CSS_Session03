      Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American
      singer-songwriter. Through her autobiographical songwriting and artistic
      versatility, she has established herself as one of the most prominent
      entertainment figures of the 21st century, becoming one of the world's
      best-selling music artists. Swift has a record seven albums that each sold
      one million copies first-week in the US. She is the highest-grossing
      touring artist, the richest female musician, and the first billionaire
      with music as the primary source of income.

      Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer
      with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The singles
      "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story", and "You Belong with Me" found
      crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She incorporated rock
      on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her
      image from country to pop with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing
      media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums
      contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "We Are Never Ever
      Getting Back Together", "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood", and
      "Look What You Made Me Do".
